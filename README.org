* Description

The native ZFS filesystem for Linux.

Ubuntu 16.04 includes ZFS support out of the box. This role adds ZFS to the
other LTS releases still within support. The goal is not to promote continued
use of older releases, but to make it easier to migrate by minimizing the
differences between the old and new.
